# 🖧 Network Monitoring Lab  
A mini lab simulating how NOC teams monitor and respond to network health alerts.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- **Ping** and **Traceroute** for connectivity testing  
- **PRTG / Zabbix / Nagios** (demo or simulation via YouTube sandbox)  
- **Wireshark** for packet analysis  
- **Google Sheets** or **Grafana** for mock dashboards  

---

## 🧩 Project Overview  
This project explores how network operations centers monitor device uptime, bandwidth usage, and latency.

**Main goals:**  
- Simulate a small office network (using Packet Tracer or diagrams)  
- Create sample “monitoring alerts” and document troubleshooting steps  
- Analyze ICMP and DNS traffic in Wireshark  
- Draft an example escalation report for a simulated outage

## 📈 Results  
✅ Identified latency between router and switch using ping test  
✅ Created simple uptime graph  
✅ Wrote sample NOC alert summary for team escalation

## 💡 Key Skills  
Networking • Troubleshooting • Monitoring • Documentation • Communication
